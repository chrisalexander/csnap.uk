I'm an engineer who likes taking photos as a hobby. You can find my main website [here](https://chris-alexander.co.uk).

I am available for occasional shoots but I don't rely on it as a source of income. If you have a paid gig, please consider creatives who are relying on your custom.

Images are available for sale and licensing, please get in touch via chris@chris-alexander.co.uk.
