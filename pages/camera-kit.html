        <h2>Canon 5D Mark III</h2>

                target="_blank">Clip</a>.</p>

        <p>I bought this body used in the summer of 2019 and it has been really excellent so far. The grip and clip are
            also outstanding.</p>

        <h2>Canon EF 28-70mm f/2.8 L USM</h2>

        <img class="center" src="https://camediahost.github.io/camera-kit/28-70.jpg" />

        <p>While this lens is incredibly heavy, I found a second hand one for a reasonable price and I am very pleased
            with the quality of photos I am getting with it. Fully deserves its reputation. (<a

        <h2>Canon EF 17-40mm f/4 L USM</h2>

        <img class="center" src="https://camediahost.github.io/camera-kit/17-40.jpg" />

        <p>I picked this one up at the same time I got the 28-70 and the 5D body. When I was shooting my old Canon 1000D
            (APS-C sensor) I used the Canon 10-22mm EF-S lens and I would have missed it. I have really enjoyed using
            this one. (<a
                href="http://g.chris-alexander.co.uk?id=1274X516320&xs=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mpb.com%2Fen-uk%2Fused-equipment%2Fused-photo-and-video%2Fused-lenses%2Fused-canon-fit-lenses%2Fcanon-ef-17-40mm-f-4-l-usm%2F"
                target="_blank">MPB</a>)</p>

        <h2>Canon EF 70-300mm f/4-5.6 IS USM</h2>

        <img class="center" src="https://camediahost.github.io/camera-kit/70-300.jpg" />

        <p>This is a great telephoto zoom that doesn't break the bank or your back. I am consistently amazed at the
            image stablisation. I carried this over from the 1000D so lost a little bit of equivalent zoom but at 300mm
            it is still more than enough.</p>

        <h2>Canon EF 50mm f/1.8 II</h2>

        <img class="center" src="https://camediahost.github.io/camera-kit/50.jpg" />

        <p>The renowned budget 50mm has been in my bag since almost the beginning. It will soon be time to pass it on to
            someone else and switch to either <a
                href="http://g.chris-alexander.co.uk?id=1274X516320&xs=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.canon.co.uk%2Flenses%2Fef-50mm-f-1-8-stm-lens%2F"
                target="_blank">the new version</a> (which has acquired USM) or a used f/1.4. (<a
                href="http://g.chris-alexander.co.uk?id=1274X516320&xs=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mpb.com%2Fen-uk%2Fused-equipment%2Fused-photo-and-video%2Fused-lenses%2Fused-canon-fit-lenses%2Fcanon-ef-50mm-f-1-8-ii%2F"

        <h2>Canon EF 40mm f/2.8 STM</h2>

        <img class="center" src="https://camediahost.github.io/camera-kit/40.jpg" />

        <p>The tiny "pancake" lens is great for "normal" perspectives, I love shooting landscapes outside with it. If
            you pop it on and take the battery grip off, also super inconspicuous. STM is a great compromise as it is
            quiet and pretty fast, and small enough to fit in the package. (<a
                href="http://g.chris-alexander.co.uk?id=1274X516320&xs=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mpb.com%2Fen-uk%2Fused-equipment%2Fused-photo-and-video%2Fused-lenses%2Fused-canon-fit-lenses%2Fcanon-ef-40mm-f-2-8-stm%2F"

        <h2>Manfrotto ProLight backpack RedBee-310</h2>

        <img class="center" src="https://camediahost.github.io/camera-kit/backpack.jpg" />

        <p>When I bought the 5D body I needed a bigger camera bag - that much weight wouldn't work on the
            over-the-shoulder bag I used to have. The requirements were pretty simple - comfortable, big enough for
            everything on this page and a bit more, side access, quick camera access, won't break the bank. Turns out
            it's quite tricky to do that all in one bag, but this one does the job. (<a
